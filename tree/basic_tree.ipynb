    "#### Basic Tree\n",
    "- In case of trees buttom up approach will never work, always think in top-down recursive approach. Because we traverse tree from top to down, as there is no easy way to traverse tree from bottom up it's hard to think that way.\n",
    "- Always try to solve using nonlocal vaiables, then improve upon them.\n",
    "- A tree where ever node have only two child is called binary tree.\n",
    "- A balanced binary tree is the binary tree where the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1. \n",
    "- A complete binary tree is a binary tree whose all levels except the last level are completely filled and all the leaves in the last level are all to the left side.\n",
    "- We can traverse trees in two way: \n",
    "    1. Depth First Search (DFS)\n",
    "    2. Breadth First Search (BFS)\n",
    "- DFS can be devided into tree sub catagories:\n",
    "    1. Inorder (left-node-right)\n",
    "    2. Preorder (node-left-right)\n",
    "    3. Postorder (left-right-node)\n",
    "- BFS is also known as level order traversal. Generally DEQue is used for level order traversal."
